Contribution Guidelines
Create a new branch and a PR for each new feature simultaneously
Do update CHANGELOG.md - Learn Markdown
Get your code reviewed and approved before merging it into alpha branch
You should only commit the source code to this repo. Content in node_modules, bower_components and build should be ignored.
All third party dependencies should be handled via bower until we make custom changes to them.
cdn-data.json is the file referred by gulp during the production build to setup the cdn's of all the devepenencies installed via bower. Do mention the CDN for your dependency if any.
